# pass-generator

## Description

This project's motivation was to utilize aspects of JavaScript to create a website that would be able to generate a random password based off user input. The project was built to take a deeper look into my processes of debugging as well as JavaScript writing to be able to produce a password generator that would be able to ask a user information and generate a password that would fit the users inputs. I learned that the debugging process of JavaScript writing takes lot of patience, and requires one to take a step back to really read out what one's code is doing at each step.

## Installation

Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code.
Once you are at the correct repo, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal. Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.
When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally. 

For Windows: git clone "key that was copied to your clipboard" --> enter

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button

Once you have clicked on the button, the user will be prompted with several factors that are to be answered/confirmed to be used as paramaters when generating the random password.

[lowercase characters](assets/images/lowercase.jpg)
[uppercase characters](assets/images/uppercase.jpg)

Once you have selected your choices and they are valid selections to generate a password, you will see a randomly generated password in the center of the text box.
